# Google Review Growth System for Hospitality — Selling Guide

**Don’t sell this as “AI Feedback System”. Sell it as “Google Review Growth System for Hospitality”.** That framing closes deals.

---

## 1. Market problems (validated)

Restaurants & hotels struggle with:

- Getting **more Google reviews** (not just 5-stars, but **detailed** ones)
- **Inconsistent feedback** (complaints come late or publicly)
- **Managers don’t understand patterns** in reviews
- **No time** to reply to reviews properly
- **No ROI visibility** from reviews

## 2. What actually makes them pay

They don’t pay for AI. They pay for:

| Outcome | How this product delivers |
|--------|----------------------------|
| Higher Google ranking | More detailed, SEO-friendly reviews from real guests |
| More positive reviews | Gamified, quick feedback → AI turns it into a review → one-click post |
| Repeat customers | Incentives (rewards) + optional phone/context for retention campaigns |
| Damage control | Low ratings → private feedback; high ratings → Google (ethical gating) |

## 3. Product structure (optimized for selling)

### Customer side (QR experience)

- **Two options:** Explore Menu/Services **or** Give Feedback & Win a Reward
- **Feedback:** Max 5–7 micro-steps, emoji ratings, optional image, optional text, AI review preview, one-click to Google
- **Target metrics:** Scan → completion 65–80%; Completion → Google review 50–70%; &lt; 45 sec; &lt; 20% typing

### Admin (where money is made)

1. **AI Performance Dashboard** — Aspect scores (Cleanliness, Service, Food/Room, Value) with color (green/orange/red)
2. **AI Insights** — Plain English, e.g. “Customers love food but complain about slow service at 7–9 PM”
3. **Google Review Management** — Auto-reply modes (Auto / Guided / Manual), reply styles (Professional, Warm, Apologetic, Luxury, Casual)
4. **Customer Retention** — Phone + visit context → personalized offers, apology coupons, WhatsApp/SMS (later)

## 4. Features that beat competitors

- **Smart review gating:** &lt; 3★ → private feedback; ≥ 4★ → Google review
- **Competitive benchmarking:** “Your service rating is 18% lower than nearby restaurants”
- **Staff performance heatmap:** “Service complaints mostly mention evening staff” (non-punitive)
- **Multi-location support** — Chains & hotel groups = bigger contracts
